📄 1. Abstract
This project demonstrates a basic AI Chatbot system for customer support implemented in C. It simulates real-time user interaction by routing and responding to queries using key data structures: Tree (for intent matching), Queue (for managing multiple queries), and Linked List (for chat history). The system emphasizes understanding core data structure logic in a practical application.

🧠 2. Introduction
AI chatbots improve customer service efficiency. This project uses C programming to build a simple, rule-based chatbot system that simulates conversation. The goal is not just chatbot functionality, but to highlight the use of fundamental data structures in such systems.

🎯 3. Objectives
•	To build a chatbot capable of basic customer support conversation.
•	To implement Tree, Queue, and Linked List in C.
•	To simulate how these structures can support logic flow and memory in an AI system.
•	To demonstrate how data structures apply to practical programming problems.

🏗️ 4. System Architecture
•	User Input Layer: Takes text input from the user.
•	Intent Matcher (Tree): Matches input to a predefined category.
•	Query Queue (Queue): Holds pending queries.
•	History Log (Linked List): Saves the interaction log dynamically.
•	Response Layer: Generates appropriate replies.

⚙️ 5. Algorithms Used
•	Tree Traversal (for matching user queries).
•	Queue Enqueue/Dequeue (for ordered processing).
•	Linked List Insertion (for chat history storage).

🧩 6. Data Structures Overview
6.1 Tree
Used as a decision tree where each node represents a topic/intention and links to possible user follow-ups.
6.2 Queue
Implements first-come-first-serve behaviour to handle incoming user queries.
6.3 Linked List
Stores the entire chat transcript between the user and chatbot.

✅ 7. Conclusion
This project effectively demonstrates the use of Tree, Queue, and Linked List in a chatbot system using C. While the chatbot logic is basic, it reflects how low-level data structures support AI behaviour simulation.
